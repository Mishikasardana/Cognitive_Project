# Book Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a **Book Recommendation System** implemented in Jupyter Notebook using Python. The system leverages machine learning and data analysis techniques to suggest books based on user preferences.

## Features
- Provides book recommendations based on user input
- Uses collaborative filtering and KNN for recommendation
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation using Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Surprise

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn surprise
```

Alternatively, you can install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook book-recommendation-system.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data and generate book recommendations.
3. Modify the input parameters as needed to customize recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Collaborative Filtering, KNN, Cosine Similarity

## Dataset
